                    The Gambia facts: 
                        Weather: It's hot, June-October wet, October-June dry 

                        Culture: 95% Muslim meaning conservative clothes, bright colors and patterns, tattoos and jewelry are okay with a question mark - addressed later in the list
                            Female presenting requirements: 
                            1. Shoulders are typically covered (varies based on community) 
                            2. Bottoms go passed knees
                            
                            Male presenting requirements: 
                            1. None           
                </p>       
                <p>
                    The packing facts: 4 bags (2 carry-on some airlines have weight requirements, 2 checked bags both with 50lb limits)
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I started to pack for the next few years, these were the facts I used as reference points. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in Portland, Oregon the idea of constant heat and living in a muslim culture was a bit daunting. Portland, with its sporatic rain, occasional snow days, and progressively warmer summers has never experienced dry dusty heat or showers sheltering people in place. (transition) Nor have I lived in a community heavily influenced by religion. Suffice it to say, there were elements of this experience I could not prepare for and (saying for letting go of control).    
                </p>   
                <p>
                    So, I turned my attention to packing. I started with a spreadsheet and broke down my life into the essentials, the mildly unoptionals, and the sacrificials. Referencing blogs I found from years ago and chatting with a current Peace Corps Volunteer, I built this list with a bit of obsession and creativity. 
                </p>    
                    
                    
                    

                    
                    A few disclaimers:

                    - List accuracy: untested; have yet to land in country but will update the list throughout my service
                    - Staging: They recommend wearing business casual, build an outfit from something you will wear in country. If it is going to sit in your closet collecting dust for the next 2 years don't bring it. I wore my black plastic birkenstocks, jeans and a sweater. 
                    - Gifts: The peace corps might send a few random emails about not bringing gifts. I would disregard them, if your living with a family for two years it's nice to bring something, but keep it small. More details below. 
                    - Food vs anything else: My impression is that most people regret not bringing more food
                    - Think light: All the random trinkets add up so pack efficiently; also solar lights - if you have a bit of money to spend, lights are great personal investment or gift
                    - HUGE: In our last meeting, someone mentioned that PCVs recieve discounts. As volunteers you qualify for an online program called Expert voice. I wish I new about it sooner, (better explanation) but they work with different companies to provide discounts for certain organizations - vague, I know, just look it up. Also, some volunteers in the past have noted discounts when shopping for Peace Corps prep items. Just mention you're doing Peace Corps at the counter. You can sometimes get free coffee beans or discounts at outdoor stores.
