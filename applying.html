                    There are two ways to apply as a peace corps volunteer, one: you apply directly to a program or two: you apply to where most needed. Applying to where most needed will still allow you to select for countries/regions, language, or sector (agriculture, education...) of interest. If you love working with children and want to be placed in a spanish speaking country doing youth development, this is the way to go. However, if none of the programs speak to you, keep in mind that every few months the peace corps will rollout new programs as some application deadlines come to a close. 
                </p>

                    The application requires a motivation statement and a resume. The resume tells the peace corps why you are right for them and the motivation statement explains why peace corps is right for you. The motivation statement is about 500 words, focusing on why you want to serve and how you plan to overcome challenges. The key is to remember to write about the later. Acknowledge a few specific challenges and explain how you plan to overcome them. Many applicants will neglect this section and focus solely on why they want to serve. When you do write about the why, make sure to talk directly about Peace Corps. There are countless programs that allow you to work abroad or help others, so what makes this program stand out? Remember that the motivation statement is not a cover letter. An officer will closely read your resume and motivation statement, so try not to repeat points from your resume in the motivation statement or add nuance if you do. Here are a couple of helpful questions to think about if you are stuck (courtesy of my peace corps advisor): 
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. In what moment did you decide to apply to Peace Corps?
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. What skills do you have that support the program or sector you're interestd in?
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. How to do you plan to manage the emotional, physical, and intellectual challenges you may face in Peace Corps?
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Has anyone helped you get to this point in your life and why is that important?
                </p>   
                <p>
                    5. Have you had to integrate into a new community?
                </p>    
                <p>
                    6. How have you handled being away from friends and family for an extended period of time?
                </p>   
                <p>
                    7. How will you manage having less structure in your day?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the resume, it should be around 2-3 pages. Be sure to include: key qualifactions, quantified experiences, certifications, language and leadership skills. Key qualifications should be listed right under your name and summarize in 3-4 bullet points skills that speak to the program(s) you applied to. Quantify your experiences, if you worked at a clinic for 3 years, one bullet point might include the average number of patients you saw per day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you start the process, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. Set your expectations low, stay organized, and check your email frequently. After applying, it may be several weeks before you hear a response regarding your application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you recieve an interview, they will email the questions before hand. At this point you will know which program you are being interviewed for so do a bit of research on the specifics of the country and program. As with any interview come prepared and also capitalize on the digital platform. You can keep a few notes on your computer as guidelines for the interview. It should last around 1.5-2 hours. The first half will be structured and interviewers are not supposed react which can come off as a bit cold, just know that this behavior is normal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continue checking your email after the interview, if you recieve an offfer then you will have three days to reject or accept. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Best of luck if you are applying :)
